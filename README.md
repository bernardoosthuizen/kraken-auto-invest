# Kraken - Auto Invest

## Description
This is a simple bot that helps you automatically and periodically buy selected cryptocurrencies on Kraken crypto exchange. I hope to gain confidence in using APIs and their documentation with Node.js.

### Reflections
This project was more challenging than expected. Initially I intended not to use any helper packages. After going through their API documentation and other resources I realised for the time being I will need to use a helper package (npm-kraken-api). I was taken aback as to how unclear the API documentation was for me. I will continue building this project using the helper package and once I have a bit more experience I will redo this project as initially intended. This project has been a really good learning experience, which I enjoyed.
